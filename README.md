## Quiz with JS OOP

A lightweight Quiz application created with JavaScript OOP.

This mini project was a lightweight javascript-based quiz taker, done in order to pick up and further strengthen my skills using object oriented programming in JavaScript. 

As a result whilst it isn't the prettiest or most functional it  was done in order to increase my proficiency level in various programming languages.
